At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative and interactive features designed to enhance student learning.

Welcome to *U.S. History*, an OpenStax College resource. This textbook has been created with several goals in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement—all while encouraging students toward high levels of academic scholarship. Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a strong foundation in U.S. history in an accessible format.

# About OpenStax College   {#eip-38}

Through our partnerships with companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students, OpenStax College is working to improve access to higher education for all. OpenStax College is an initiative of Rice University and is made possible through the generous support of several philanthropic foundations.

# About OpenStax College’s Resources   {#eip-941}

OpenStax College resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others: they can be customized by instructors for each class, they are a “living” resource that grows online through contributions from educators, and they are available free or for minimal cost.

## Customization   {#eip-784}

OpenStax College learning resources are designed to be customized for each course. Our textbooks are developed to meet the scope and sequence of a typical course and; therefore, provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build, and our resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind. Instructors can select the sections most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their classes and student body. Teachers are encouraged to expand on existing examples by adding unique context via geographically localized applications and topical connections.

*U.S. History* can be easily customized using our online platform (http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col11740/latest/). Simply select the content most relevant to your current semester and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of your class. U.S. History is organized as a collection of sections that can be rearranged, modified, and enhanced through localized examples or to incorporate a specific theme of your course. This customization feature will ensure that your textbook truly reflects the goals of your course.

## Cost   {#eip-790}

Our textbooks are available for free online, and also in low-cost print and iBook textbook editions.

# About *U.S. History*   {#eip-218}

*U.S. History* has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most introductory U.S. History courses. At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning. Instructors can also customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.

## Coverage and Scope   {#eip-177}

To develop *U.S. History*, we solicited ideas from historians at all levels of higher education, from community colleges to Ph.D.-granting universities. They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet their and their students’ needs.

The result is a book that covers the breadth of the chronological history of the United States and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. *U.S. History* explores the key forces and major developments that together form the American experience, with particular attention paid to considering issues of race, class, and gender.

The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary. Reviewer feedback centered around achieving equilibrium between the various political, social, and cultural dynamics that permeate history. The outcome is a balanced approach to U.S. history, considering the people, events, and ideas that have shaped the United States from both the top down (politics, economics, diplomacy) and bottom up (eyewitness accounts, lived experience).

While the book is organized primarily chronologically, as needed, material treating different topics or regions over the same time period is spread over multiple chapters. For example, chapters 9, 11, and 12 look at economic, political, social, and cultural developments during the first half of the eighteenth century in the North, West, and South respectively, while chapters 18 to 20 closely examine industrialization, urbanization, and politics in the period after Reconstruction.

Throughout the OpenStax version of U.S. History, you will find featured material that engage the students in historical inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1170458321993"><span data-type="item">**Americana**\: This feature explores the significance of artifacts from American pop culture and considers what values, views, and philosophies are reflected in these objects.</span> <span data-type="item">**Defining “American”**\: This feature analyzes primary sources, including documents, speeches, and other writings, to consider important issues of the day and present varying points of view on them, while keeping a focus on the theme of what it means to be American.</span> <span data-type="item">**My Story**\: This feature presents first-person accounts (diaries, interviews, letters) of significant or exceptional events from the American experience.</span> <span data-type="item">**Link It Up**\: This feature is a very brief introduction to a website with an interactive experience, video, or primary sources that help improve student understanding of the material.</span> </span>

## Questions for Each Level of Learning   {#eip-924}

The OpenStax version of *U.S. History* offers two types of end-of-module questions for students.<span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1172552840080"><span data-type="item">**Review Questions** are simple recall questions from each module in the chapter and are in either multiple-choice or open-response format. The answers can be looked up in the text.</span> <span data-type="item">**Critical Thinking Questions** are higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to *demonstrate their understanding by applying* what they have learned in each module to the whole of the chapter. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for *reasoning* about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn’t have thought of going themselves. </span> </span>
