U.S. History is designed for a two-semester American history sequence. It is traditional in coverage, following a roughly chronological outline, and using a balanced approach that includes political, economic, social, and cultural developments. At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative and interactive features designed to enhance student learning. Instructors can also customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.

### About *U.S. History*   {#eip-218}

*U.S. History* is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of most introductory courses. The text provides a balanced approach to U.S. history, considering the people, events, and ideas that have shaped the United States from both the top down (politics, economics, diplomacy) and bottom up (eyewitness accounts, lived experience). U.S. History covers key forces that form the American experience, with particular attention to issues of race, class, and gender.

#### Coverage and Scope   {#eip-177}

To develop *U.S. History*, we solicited ideas from historians at all levels of higher education, from community colleges to PhD-granting universities. They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet the needs of them and their students.The result is a book that covers the breadth of the chronological history of the United States and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike.

The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary. Reviewer feedback centered around achieving equilibrium between the various political, social, and cultural dynamics that permeate history.

While the book is organized primarily chronologically, as needed, material treating different topics or regions over the same time period is spread over multiple chapters. For example, chapters 9, 11, and 12 look at economic, political, social, and cultural developments during the first half of the eighteenth century in the North, West, and South respectively, while chapters 18 to 20 closely examine industrialization, urbanization, and politics in the period after Reconstruction.

#### Pedagogical Foundation    {#eip-26}

*U.S. History* features material that takes topics one step further to engage students in historical inquiry.Our features include:

* **Americana**. This feature explores the significance of artifacts from American pop culture and considers what values, views, and philosophies are reflected in these objects.
* **Defining “American”**. This feature analyzes primary sources, including documents, speeches, and other writings, to consider important issues of the day while keeping a focus on the theme of what it means to be American.
* **My Story**. This feature presents first-person accounts (diaries, interviews, letters) of significant or exceptional events from the American experience.
* **Link It Up**. This feature is a very brief introduction to a website with an interactive experience, video, or primary sources that help improve student understanding of the material.

#### Questions for Each Level of Learning   {#eip-924}

*U.S. History* offers two types of end-of-module questions for students:

* **Review Questions** are simple recall questions from each module in the chapter and are in either multiple-choice or open-response format. The answers can be looked up in the text.
* **Critical Thinking Questions** are higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to demonstrate their understanding by applying what they have learned in each module to the whole of the chapter. They ask for outside-the-box thinking and reasoning about the concepts pushing students to places they wouldn’t have thought of going themselves.
